This paper explains how the Grover algorithm is structured and how it solves the unstructured search problem. There will be different visualization and explanations for each step of the algorithm and the circuits needed to build a quantum system solving the Grover algorithm. Furthermore the paper will analyze the behavior of the algorithm on different scenarios and will give different techniques to improve the solution.
